# Introduction

We need to integrate Selenium automation testing into the SDX-Meican project to enhance its UI-level testing capabilities and ensure robustness in our software releases.

# Objective:

The primary goal of this task is to establish a Selenium-based automation framework tailored specifically for SDX-Meican. This framework will allow us to automate the testing of critical functionalities at the UI level, improve test coverage, and streamline our testing processes.

# Scope:

**Framework Setup**: Set up a Selenium automation framework compatible with the SDX-Meican project environment.
**Test Script Development**: Develop test scripts to cover key features and user workflows of SDX-Meican.
**Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate the automation tests with our continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to ensure tests run automatically with each build.
**Reporting and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track test results and identify issues efficiently.
**Maintenance and Scalability**: Ensure the automation framework is easily maintainable and scalable to accommodate future changes and additions to the SDX-Meican application.
**Expected Deliverables**:

Fully functional Selenium automation framework integrated into the SDX-Meican project.
Test scripts covering essential functionalities and user scenarios.
Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
Documentation detailing setup instructions, usage guidelines, and maintenance procedures.
